pyXem is an open-source python library for crystallographic diffraction microscopy.

The package defines objects and functions for the analysis of numerous diffraction patterns and has been primarily developed as a platform for hybrid diffraction-microscopy based on 4D scanning diffraction microscopy data in which a 2D diffraction pattern is recorded at every position in a 2D scan of a specimen.

Python library for analysing pixelated scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) datasets.
Pixelated STEM is using a 2D detector to image the convergent beam electron pattern generated by the electron beam after passing through a material.

The library has implemented several common functions used with these types of datasets, like radial averaging and center of mass.
These are implemented as HyperSpy-type signals, where these new signals both inherit the old methods and add many new ones.

**Installation instructions, documentation and tutorial examples are available** `here <https://pyxem.github.io/pyxem-website>`__ .

If analysis using pyXem forms a part of published work please cite the DOI at the top of this page.

pyXem is released under the GPL v3 license.
